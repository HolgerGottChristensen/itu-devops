# Distributed workflow for this repository

After our team discussion, we all agree to the following:

1. We use this repository to store all code related to the project
2. To start working on this project, follow the instructions in the README file.
3. The main branch of this repo is **master**. Noone can push directly to this branch. You need to open a pull request to change code there.
4. Any contributor in the project can create a branch and propose the change. The name of the branch and commits should be meaningful.
5. Used strategy to merge pull requests is **squash and merge**.
6. Our distributed development workflow is the centralized workflow. One repository can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work with it. A number of developers are nodes — consumers of that hub — and synchronize with that centralized location.
7. Anyone can contribute to the project. Contributions need to be well described and the code needs to compile as well as the name of the branch and commits should be meaningful.
8. There is an email list of current contributions to the project that can review and integrate pull requests:

- hoch@itu.dk
- ende@itu.dk
- muki@itu.dk
- dawo@itu.dk
